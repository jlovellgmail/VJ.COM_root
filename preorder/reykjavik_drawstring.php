							All of our leather products are made with the finest quality calfskin from, arguably, the best tannery in Italy. Nearly 100 years in business, this partner is one of the most modern and environmentally safe processors in the world. The leather quality - color, finish consistency, absence of flaws - speaks for itself.

							Virgil James only uses what we consider to be the best zipper in the world. Manufactured in Italy, they are expensive but worth every Euro. They pull like a knife through butter, with just enough, but never too much, resistance. They won't catch or tear. They simply don't fail. It's not difficult to get excited about these components which exhibit the best in design and industrial technology.

							All of the metal components (buttons, feet, zipper pulls, and rings) used by Virgil James are custom made. Each piece is designed by our artists, cast in ancient bronze using the lost-wax casting method, and then plated for a polished (or brushed) nickel finish. Harder than rock, these pieces will last forever. Their design is intended to reflect each unique collection.
