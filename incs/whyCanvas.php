			<h2 class="">Why Canvas?</h2>
			<p class="collectionIntroP eight">We love this material because it provides an amazing background to highlight leather trim and metal hardware. It’s also one of the most basic fabrics we can imagine, beautiful in its neutral tone and natural simplicity. It evokes a casual, working-class lifestyle that can be surprisingly high-end. Best of all, it’s virtually indestructible.</p>

					<h4>100% Italian Canvas</h4>
					<h5>Like nothing you've seen before.</h5>
					<p>Our 100% cotton 2-ply canvas is made in Italy with a simple plain weave. It’s definitely not the everyday canvas you see at the beach or at the local grocery store. It’s supple, yet strong. It shapes well and when accompanied by Italian calf leather, our custom hardware, and zippers like none you’ve ever seen, this canvas is a stunning backdrop. It’s also treated to resist water and stains, which turns out to be pretty convenient.</p>

					<h4>Made in the USA</h4>
					<h5>The New Stamp of Quality.</h5>
					<p>In every corner of the word, you can find great craftsman, and most are a lot less expensive than those in America. We still prefer, however, to make our products in the USA. We can communicate directly and maintain more control over the final product. We’ve also found that in a country with so much wealth and so many employment alternatives, American craftsman have consciously chosen to do what they do, with a commitment and pride equal to their counterparts anywhere in the world.</p>
