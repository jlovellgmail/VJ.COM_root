            <h2 class='about-name-title'>Jay McGoodwin</h2>
            <p>Starting a luxury fashion company was probably not part of Jay’s life plan, but it’s the curves in life that make it interesting. Despite an eclectic perspective and lifetime of travel, Jay followed a fairly conventional career path, particularly for a Harvard MBA. He was a private equity&nbsp;/ venture capital investor who happened to be fully engaged in the creative process. In fact, so engaged that he ultimately left the business to invest in, incubate, and work directly with early-stage companies. Serial entrepreneur maybe, but really someone who mostly enjoyed building companies and the art of creativity. Jay’s wide-ranging experience and strategic sense have created a foundation for what he promises will be an incredibly compelling, if not successful, company. We’ll look for that, but his commitment to absurd quality, authenticity, and a lifetime of functional use make him a model customer. He’s also a pretty interesting guy.</p>

            <h2 class='about-name-title'>Maya Stewart</h2>
            <p>Maya is the Creative Director at Virgil James and the force behind our design aesthetic – a unique blend of classic elegance and creative functionality.  This is not Maya’s first rodeo, which might be an apt characterization for the Oklahoma-bred daughter (and niece) of a family of acclaimed artists and designers.  Maya has the credentials and experience to do exactly what makes Virgil James so special.  She’s a graduate of the London College of Fashion, where she received the Jimmy Choo Award and Student Accessory Designer of the Year.  Her designs have been featured in Vogue, W Magazine, Women’s Wear Daily, Marie Claire, Vanity Fair and carried by names you would surely know, but we won’t name drop!  She’s designed for leading brands, but found the perfect fit at Virgil James – to the extreme delight of our customers. And, by the way, Maya is probably much more interesting than Jay.</p>
